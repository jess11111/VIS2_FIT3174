        We focus on 3 property types:

        <br>
        <strong> h = <span class='houses_text'> houses </span> </strong>
        <br>

        <strong> u = <span class='units_text'>units</span> </strong>

    <div class="intro3">
        What type of property would most suit you? 
        Which region offers you the best (or worst) buying solution based on your preferences?
        Lastly, based on recent data, during what times of the year should you make the purchase?
        Upon examination of this visualisation, answers to these questions may be made a little clearer.

        The left-most chart shows some of the most and least sought after and populated council areas around metropolitan Melbourne.
        If you're on a budget, an <span class='units_text'>unit</span> in Bayside or Yarra City Council may be most suitable. 
        

         Buying a <span class='houses_text'>house</span> will cost you around twice as much.  
         Despite the lower demand (or supply), <span class='houses_text'>houses</span> in
         Maroondah appears to be the most expensive when compared to other councils. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The heatmap below indicates that 3-4 bedroom <span class='houses_text'>houses</span> 
        were most frequently purchased/listed. 
        If you're after a 5+ bedroom property, a <span class='houses_text'>house</span> may be your only option.

        ← Left map shows the <strong> building age distribution of properties sold. </strong>
        Newer properteis will have better amenities and lower maintenance overheads.
        The north-western suburbs such as <strong>Gowanbrae</strong> appears to have sold many newly developed properties. 
        Conversely, the oldest buildings are concentarted in inner city suburbs such as 
    <strong>Fitzroy, Middle Park 
            and Kingsville.</strong>
        Older properties often have greater value in land compared to the actual building. 
        As we can see, they are located in regions with well-established infrastructure, which means these properties
        possess factors that are beneficial future capital growth.

        Right map shows the <strong> price relative to number of bedrooms </strong>. 
        Suburbs that are just outside the CBD, such as <strong>Toorak and St Kilda</strong>, 
        appear as the most expensive. You can use the <strong>dropdown tool</strong> to find these suburbs.  
        An additional ~20 km away from these suburbs, a room becomes 
    <strong>2-3 times cheaper.</strong> →

                Using Selection tools, we can observe that in recent years, <span class='townhouses_text'> townhouse </span> demand (or supply) 
                have diminished considerably. In contrast, many more <span class='units_text'>units</span> 
                have been sold in recent years as compared to ~20 years ago (particularly in Hawthorn and Glen Iris).

            Right chart shows that you will receive <strong>less land for each dollar paid
            when the property is situated closer to the CBD</strong>  
            (a square meter of land becomes more expensive). 
            Particularly for <span class='houses_text'>houses</span>, distance is slightly more influential on price than land size -
            meaning that when considering a property that either has large land or closer proximity to the city centre, 
            you may find the former option to be more economical.
            Occasionally, you will find <span class='units_text'>units</span> in the city 
            that sell for a comparably more valuable price (see small red dots near bottom). →

            On average, sales prices tend to be <strong>at the beginnging of the year and 
                gradually increase throughout the months.</strong> 
            For example, <span class='units_text'>units</span> were lowest at $560k
            in February (left) and at $1.6k/meter square of building in January (right).
             There evern appears to be
            an inverse relationship between <span class='units_text'>units</span>
             and <span class='townhouses_text'> townhouses </span> - 
             <span class='units_text'>unit</span> prices increase

            Although <span class='houses_text'> houses </span> seem like 
            the most costly type of property to purchase, 
            <span class='townhouses_text'> townhouses </span> are in fact
